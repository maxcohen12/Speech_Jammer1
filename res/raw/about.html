<h2>Microphone</h2>
<p>This is a really simple app to use. Just press the mic to start then again to stop the Speech Jammer. It will then
    relay the audio back to the speaker. You will find that the user will find it very difficult, if not impossible, to
        speak in a coherent fashion.</p>
        
<p>The reason this works is because the brain constantly requires feedback to accurately complete tasks. By relaying the
    audio back to the user at a slight delay, the muscles and feedback stimuli are out of sync and the brain will try to
    compensate (unsuccessfully).</p>
    
<p>For best results, use noise cancelling headphones, or in ear at high volume.</p>
